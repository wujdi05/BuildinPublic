# Build in Public 🚀

> An interactive case study showing how I think, design, and debug using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's This About?

Most portfolios show the finished product and call it a day. This project does something different—it pulls back the curtain on the actual *thinking* behind building a real website.

You'll see real design decisions, debugging techniques, and problem-solving in action. No frameworks, no build tools, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript showing how it all actually works.

## What You'll Find Here

✨ **Interactive Sections** – Actually play with the code decisions in real-time  
🎨 **Design Thinking** – See the reasoning behind UI choices (mobile-first vs. desktop-first)  
🐛 **Debugging in Action** – Watch how bugs get spotted and fixed  
🎭 **Dark/Light Theme** – Toggle between themes to see responsive styling  
📱 **Responsive by Default** – Built mobile-first from the ground up  
⌚ **Smooth Scroll Progress** – Visual feedback as you scroll through the journey  

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Semantic structure with proper meta tags for SEO
- **CSS** – Custom properties, responsive grid, animations
- **JavaScript** – Vanilla JS with no dependencies (IntersectionObserver, event listeners)

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the interactive case study

That's it. No build process, no install steps. Just open and go.

## Structure

```
index.html    – The main content and structure
style.css     – All styling (light/dark themes included)
script.js     – Interactive behaviors and event handling
```

## Why Build This?

I wanted to create something that actually demonstrates how I approach web development:

- **Problem-solving first** – What's the actual challenge?
- **Accessibility in mind** – Building for everyone
- **Performance matters** – Vanilla JS keeps things fast
- **Transparent process** – Showing the messy middle, not just the final result

## Key Features

### Design Decisions
See how different approaches (mobile-first vs. desktop-first) impact the final product.

### Interactive Debugging
Watch a real bug get identified and fixed in the browser.

### Performance Playground
Toggle animations and features while seeing real performance impacts.

### Scroll Progress
A visual indicator showing where you are in the journey.

## Lessons Learned

Building this taught me:
- How important it is to show your thinking process
- The power of vanilla JS for interactive experiences
- That sometimes "less is more" (no frameworks needed here)
- Accessibility and performance go hand in hand
